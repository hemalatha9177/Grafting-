      <h1><p><b>INTRODUCTION TO GRAFTING</b></p></h1>
      <h4><p>Grafting is a horicultural technique used to join partsfrom two or more plants so they grow as one.
        this methode is commonly employed to propagate trees and shrubs,especially those that do not root well from cuttings </p></h4>
       <h1><p><b>WHAT IS GRAFTING?</b></p></h1>
       <h4><p>Grafting involves taking a place of one plant,called the scion ,and attaching it to another plant ,kno as the rootstock.
        the scion become the top part of the plant,producing leaves,flowers,and fruits,while the rootstockfrom the root system and sometimes
        the lower paer of the system.the two parts must be closely related botanically for the graft to take.

      <h1><p><b>TYPES OF GRAFTING</b></p></h1>
      <h4><p>1.whip Grafting<br>
        2.cleft Grafting<br>
        3.Bud Grafting<br>
        4.Approach grafting
      </p></h4>
      <h4><p>1.whip grafting:Used for joining small plants or branches of similar size.it involves making matching sloping cuts on the scion and rootstock and securing them together</p></h4>
      <h4><p><b>2.cleft grafting:</b>used for joining a small scion to a larger rootstock.A cleft is made in the rootstock,and the scion is insertd into the cleft.</p></h4>
      <h4><p><b>3.Bud grafting:</b>Inolves inserting a bud from the scion into a slit made in the bark of the rootstock.</p></h4>
      <h4><p><b>Approch grafting:</b>Both scion and rootstock remain rooted and growing until the graft is secure, after which one of them is cut away.</p></h4>

      <h1><p><b>BENEFITS OF GRAFTING</b></p></h1>
       <h4><p><b>1.Propagation of desirable varieties:</b> Grafting allows the propagation of plants with desirable traits,such as specific fruit or floer characteristics,without relying on seeds.</p></h4>
       <h4><p><b>2.Disease resistant:</b>By using disease-resistant rootstocks,plants can be made more resilient to soil-orne disesses and pests</p></h4>
       <h4><p><b>3.Size control:</b>Dwarfing rootstocks can be used to control the size of fruits trees,making them easier to manage and harvest</p></h4>
       <h4><p><b>4.Repairing damaged plants:</b>Grafting can be ued to repair damaged trees by bridging grafts over injured areas.</p></h4>
       <h1><p><b>Requirements for successful grafting</b></p></h1>
       <h4><p><b>1.compatibility:</b>The scion and rootstock must be compatible.typically,they should or closely related species.</b></p></h4>
       <h4><p><b>2.Healthy plant material</b>:Both the scion and rootstock should be healthy and free of disease.</p></h4>
       <h4><p><b>3.Precise technique:</b>Clean,precise cuts are assential to ensure good contact between the combium layers</p></h4>
       <h4><p><b>Proper care:</b>The graft union needs to be protected and cared for until it is fully established.</p></h4>
